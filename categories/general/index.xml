      <title>Macaulay2 interface for HomotopyContinuation.jl</title>

      <description>Tim Duff pushed a very first version of a Macaulay2 interface to his Github repo. It is available in the &amp;ldquo;Julia&amp;rdquo; branch. The current version lets you export polynomials into .jl files or call HomotopyContinuation.jl directly from Macaulay2.
For instance, the following M2 code generates the file mypolynomial.jl (we assume that the functions from the Julia branch have been loaded into the current session).
R = QQ[x, y] f = {x^2 + y^2, x-y} writeSys(PolySystem f, &amp;quot;mypolynomial.</description>

      <title>The number of circles that are tangent to 3 given conics</title>

      <description>In the previous blog entry we mentioned the Macaulay2 interface for HomotopyContinuation.jl that is currently under development. In this blog post we want to show how useful this interface can be.
Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 given conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the following picture shows 42 circles that are tangent to $$C_1 = \{y=-x^2+2x+5\}, C_2 = \{y = 2x^2+5x-8\}, C_3 = \{y = 3x^2-3x-12\}.</description>

      <description>To use the true power of homotopy continuation algorithms the user should be familiar with both algebraic geometry and numerical mathematics. If you want to learn more about the relations of those two, you should come to the Summer School on Numerical Computing in Algebraic Geometry at MPI Leipzig.</description>
