      <description>In a recent discussion with Maddie Weinstein and Khazhgali Kozhasov we considered the problem of computing the maximal curvature of an algebraic manifold $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (a smooth manifold that is also a real algebraic variety ).
Our definition of maximal curvature is $\sigma: = \mathrm{sup}_{p\in V} \sigma(p)$, where $\sigma(p)$ is the maximal curvature of a geodesic through $p$:
$$\sigma(p): = \mathrm{max} \,\{\Vert \ddot{\gamma}(0)\Vert \mid \gamma \in V \text{ geodesic w.\ } \gamma(0)=p, \Vert \dot{\gamma}(0)\Vert = 1\}$$</description>

      <title>Macaulay2 interface for HomotopyContinuation.jl</title>

      <description>Tim Duff pushed a very first version of a Macaulay2 interface to his Github repo. It is available in the &amp;ldquo;Julia&amp;rdquo; branch. The current version lets you export polynomials into .jl files or call HomotopyContinuation.jl directly from Macaulay2.
For instance, the following M2 code generates the file mypolynomial.jl (I assume that the functions from the Julia branch have been loaded into the current session).
R = QQ[x, y] f = {x^2 + y^2, x-y} writeSys(PolySystem f, &amp;quot;mypolynomial.</description>

      <title>The number of circles that are tangent to 3 given conics</title>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the following picture shows 14 circles that are tangent to $$C_1 = \{y=-x^2+2x+5\}, C_2 = \{y = 2x^2+5x-8\}, C_3 = \{y = 8x^2-3x-2\}.$$
Emiris and Tzoumas write that there are 184 complex circles that are tangent to 3 general conics. This means, that there are 184 complex solutions $(a_1,a_2,r)$ such that there exists some $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ with</description>

      <description>To use the true power of homotopy continuation algorithms the user should be familiar with both algebraic geometry and numerical mathematics. If you want to learn more about the relations of those two, you should come to the Summer School on Numerical Computing in Algebraic Geometry at MPI Leipzig.</description>
