      <description>The reach $\tau$ of an embedded manifold $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an important complexity measure for methods in computational topology, statistics and machine learning. Namely, estimating $M$, or functionals of $M$, requires regularity conditions and a common regularity assumption is that the reach $\tau &amp;gt;0$. The definition of $\tau$ is as follows:
$$\tau = \sup \{t\mid \text{all $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mathrm{dist}(x,M)&amp;lt;t$ have a unique nearest point on $M$}\}$$
where the distance measure $\mathrm{dist}$ is the Euclidean distance.</description>

A four bar linkage, also called four bar, is a mechanism of four bars connected in a loop by four joints. One bar is fixed to the ground and on top of the opposing bar sits a triangle called coupler triangle whose apex is called coupler point. In motion this coupler point follows a curve called coupler curve:</description>

We want to reconstruct a three-dimensional object from two-dimensional images. Think of an object, maybe a dinosaur, that is captured by $n$ cameras from different angles. Suppose we have the following information available:
 the configuration of the cameras (in the form of camera matrices); sets of 2D points in the $n$ two-dimensional images, where each set corresponds to one 3D point.</description>

Consider the following problem: Bob has three biased coins. He tosses the first one. If it&amp;rsquo;s heads he chooses the biased coin in his left pocket, and if it&amp;rsquo;s tails he chooses the biased coin in his right pocket. Bob then flips that coin 5 times. We consider those last 5 flips as the experiment. Therefore there are 6 possible outcomes: 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, or 5 heads.</description>

      <description>The article Random points on an algebraic manifold proposes an algorithm for sampling from probability densities on a variety based on linear slicing. In this example, we want to apply this algorithm to sample from the plane curve
$$V = \{ x=(x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x_1^4+x_2^4-3x_1^2-x_1x_2^2-x_2+1=0\}.$$
intersected with the box $B = [-2,2]\times [-2,2]$.
Suppose that $f:V\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is a measurable function. We want to sample from the density $f(x)/(\int f(x)\, \mathrm{d}V)$.</description>

      <description>Cyclooctane (CH₂)₈ is a molecule that consists of eight carbon atoms aligned in a ring, and eight hydrogen atoms, each of which is attached to one of the carbon atoms. The distance $c&amp;gt;0$ between neighboring carbon atoms is fixed.
In this example, we want to study the conformation space of cyclooctane with Homotopy Continuation. The equations for the positions $z_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$ of the carbon atoms satisfy the algebraic equations
$$\Vert z_1-z_2\Vert^2 = \cdots = \Vert z_7-z_8\Vert^2=\Vert z_8-z_1\Vert^2 = c^2.</description>

      <description>Consider three Gaussian random variables $X_1,X_2,X_3$ with means $\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3$ and variances $\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2,\sigma_3^2$. The density of $X_i$ is
$$\phi_i(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\; e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}.$$
A mixture of the three random variables is the random variable $U$ with density
$$\psi(x) = a_1\, \phi_1(x)\, + \,a_2 \,\phi_2(x)\, + \,a_3 \,\phi_3(x), \quad\text{ for } \quad a_1+a_2+a_3 =1.$$
The method of moments recovers $\psi$ from the moments
$$m_k = \int x^k \,\psi(x)\; \mathrm{d}x.$$
Since we have 8 unknowns, we expect to need at least 8 moments to recover $\psi$.</description>

      <description>We want to solve following optimization problem
$$ \text{minimize} \; 3x^3y+y^2z^2-2xy-4xz^3 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad x^2+y^2+z^2=1 $$
The strategy to find the global optimum is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find all critical points of the objective function such that the equality constraint is satisfied. We start with defining our Lagrangian.
using HomotopyContinuation, DynamicPolynomials @polyvar x y z J = 3x^3*y+y^2*z^2-2x*y-x*4z^3 g = x^2+y^2+z^2-1 # Introduce auxillary variable for Lagrangian @polyvar λ # define Lagrangian L = J - λ * g  3x³y - 4xz³ + y²z² - x²λ - y²λ - z²λ - 2xy + λ  In order to compute all critical points we have to solve the square system of equations</description>

Consider a robot that consists of 7 links connected by 6 joints. The first link is fixed on the ground and the last link has a &amp;ldquo;hand&amp;rdquo;. The problem of determining the position of the hand when knowing the arrangement of the joints is called forward problem.</description>

      <title>The point on a variety that minimizes the distance to a given point</title>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing the point on
$$ V = \{x=(x_1,x_2)^T\in \mathbb{R}^2 : f(x) = 0\}, \text{ for } f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_2)^2, $$
which minimizes the distance to the point $u₀ = (-3,-2)$. The situation looks like this:
The minimizer $x^\star$ is a solution to the system
$$ F_u = \begin{bmatrix}\det(\begin{bmatrix}x-u &amp;amp; \nabla_x(f)\end{bmatrix})\\ f(x)\end{bmatrix} =0, $$
where $\nabla_x(f)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$.</description>

      <description>Let two ellipses be centered at points $p_1,p_2$: $$ E_i( r ) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x-p_i)^T Q_i^TQ_i(x-p_i) = r^2\},\; i=1,2, $$ where $Q_1, Q_2$ are symmetric matrices.
We wish to find the smallest radius $r$ for which $E_1( r )\cap E_2( r )$ is not empty. Let $r^\star$ be the solution for this optimization problem. In Julia we translate this into a polynomial system:
using HomotopyContinuation, LinearAlgebra # generate the variables @polyvar Q₁[1:2, 1:2] Q₂[1:2, 1:2] p₁[1:2] p₂[1:2] @polyvar x[1:2] r z₁ = x - p₁ z₂ = x - p₂ # initialize the equations for E₁ and E₂ f₁ = (Q₁ * z₁) ⋅ (Q₁ * z₁) - r^2 f₂ = (Q₂ * z₂) ⋅ (Q₂ * z₂) - r^2 # initialize the equation for E₁ and E₂ being tangent @polyvar λ g = (Q₁&#39; * Q₁) * z₁ - λ .</description>

      <description>Consider the problem of numerically approximating an integral of the form
$$\int \,f(x) \, \mathrm{d}V,$$
where $V\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is an algebraic manifold, $\mathrm{d}V$ is the volume form on $V$ and $f:V\to \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function.
For instance, for $f(x)=1$, this integral gives the volume of $V$. In this example, we want to use homotopy continuation to approximate this integral. We will use the Monte Carlo integration scheme proposed in this article.</description>

      <description>In this blog I want to repeat the computations from the article &amp;ldquo;Homotopy Techniques for Tensor Decomposition and Perfect Identifiability&amp;rdquo; by Hauenstein, Oeding, Ottaviani and Sommese. In that article they compute the number of canonical polyadic decompositions (CPD) of a random $2\times 2\times 2\times 3$-tensor by using the monodromy method. It is known that with probability one a random complex $2\times 2\times 2\times 3$-tensor has rank equal to 4:
$$ T = \sum_{i=1}^4 a_i \otimes b_i \otimes c_i \otimes d_i,$$</description>

      <description>A complex sextic curve in $\mathbb{C}^3$ is the intersection of a cubic surface $\mathcal{C}\subset \mathbb{C}^3$ with a quadric $\mathcal{Q}\subset \mathbb{C}^3$; that is, there exist polynomials in three variables $C$ of degree 3 and $Q$ of degree 2, such that $\mathcal{C} = \{x\in\mathbb{C}^3 : C(x) = 0\}$ and $\mathcal{Q} = \{x\in\mathbb{C}^3 : Q(x) = 0\}$.
An interesting fact about such sextic curves is that they have 120 complex tritangents (at least almost all of them).</description>

      <description>Curvature of curves in the plane Consider the problem of computing the point on a (smooth) curve $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where the curvature is maximal. We can use the following formula for curvature at a point $p\in V = \{f(x_1,x_2)=0\}$.
$$\sigma(p) = \frac{v^T H v}{g^\frac{3}{2}}$$
where $v^T \,\nabla_p f(p) = 0$, and $v^T \, v=1$, and $H$ is the Hessian of $f$ at $p$, and $g = \nabla_p f(p)^T\nabla_p f(p)$. The conditions for $\sigma(p)$ being maximal on $V$ are thus $v^T \, \nabla_p \sigma(p)=0$ and $f(p)=0$.</description>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the following picture shows 14 circles that are tangent to
$$C_1 = \{y=-x^2+2x+5\},$$
$$C_2 = \{y = 2x^2+5x-8\},$$
$$C_3 = \{y = 8x^2-3x-2\}.$$
Emiris and Tzoumas write that there are 184 complex circles that are tangent to 3 general conics. This means, that there are 184 complex solutions $(a_1,a_2,r)$ such that there exists some $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ with</description>
