A [*conic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic) in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the zero set of a
quadratic polynomial in two variables:

$$ \,\, a_1 x^2 \,+\, a_2 xy \,+\, a_3 y^2 \, +\, a_4 x \, + \, a_5 y \, + \, a_6 \,.$$

Geometrically, a conic can be either a circle, an ellipse, a hyperbola, a parabola or a union of two lines.
The last case is called a degenerate conic.


A classic problem in [enumerative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_geometry)
is [Steiner's conic problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner%27s_conic_problem) which asks:
<p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
*How many conics are tangent to five given conics?*
</p>

Here is an example of Steiner's problem:

  <figcaption>The five given conics are represented in blue. The red ellipse is tangential to all five blue conics. The tangential points are shown in black.</figcaption>
</figure>

Steiner himself claimed in 1848 that there are at most 7776.
He phrased his problem as that of solving five equations
of degree six on the five-dimensional space $\mathbb{P}^5$.
Using Bézout's Theorem he argued that the equations coming from this question
have $6^5 = 7776$ solutions over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers).
However, this number over counts because
there is a *Veronese surface* of extraneous solutions, namely 
the conics that are squares of linear forms, i.e., degenerate conics.


The correct count of non-degenerate conics is **3264**.
This was shown in 1859 by [Jonquières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_de_Jonquières) and
independently in 1864 by [Chasles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chasles).
Schubert, whose 1879 book led to Hilbert's 15th problem, developed this further, and thus to the 20th century development of intersection theory.
The number 3264 appears prominently in the book
[*3264 and all that*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/joeharris/files/000-final-3264.pdf)
by [Eisenbud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eisenbud) and
[Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Harris_(mathematician)).
It is worth mentioning that it was not until the work of [Fulton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chasles) and [MacPherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacPherson) in 1978 who gave intersection theory a rigorous foundation.

A delightful introduction to Steiner's problem was given by
[Bashelor, Ksir and Traves](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Bashelor.pdf).
[Ronga, Tognoli and Vust](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.36.1425&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Sottile](https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9609007) showed how to
choose five real conics such that all
3264 complex solutions are real. 
Although their proofs starts with an explicit construction it is *not* fully constructive.
They have to rely on the [implicit function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem) to guarantee the existence of all real solutions.

But using methods from [numerical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algebraic_geometry)
we can use the proposed construction to find a concrete instance such that there are 3264 real conics tangent to the five given conics.
In particular we use *homotopy continuation* to compute approximations of the 3264 conics.
Then we can use [Smale's $\alpha$-theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4984-9_13), via the software [alphaCertified](http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/research/stories/alphaCertified/), to give a *mathematical proof* that we found indeed 3264 real conics.

Five hyperbolas for which there exists 3264 tangential conics are given by
$$

\end{array}

$$

An illustration of the arrangement is shown below. These hyperbolas look nearly like double lines
since the construction started with double lines and then slightly perturbed them.
