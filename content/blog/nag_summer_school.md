To use the true power of homotopy continuation algorithms the user should be familiar with both algebraic geometry and numerical mathematics. If you want to learn more about the relations of those two, you should come to the [Summer School on Numerical Computing in Algebraic Geometry at MPI Leipzig](https://www.mis.mpg.de/calendar/conferences/2018/nc2018.html).
