A [*conic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic) in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the zero set of a
quadratic polynomial in two variables:

<p class="general-conic">
    $$\,\, a_1 x^2 \,+\, a_2 xy \,+\, a_3 y^2 \, +\, a_4 x \, + \, a_5 y \, + \, a_6 \,.$$
</p>

Geometrically, a conic can be either a circle, an ellipse, a hyperbola, a parabola or a union of two lines.
The last case is called a degenerate conic.


[Steiner's conic problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner%27s_conic_problem) asks the question of how many conics are tangent to five given conics. This webpage gives an answer to a slightly different question:
<p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
*Which conics are tangent to your five given conics?*
</p>

Plug in the coefficients of your five personal conics, and get the answers in a second (your conics must be sufficiently generic in the sense that the 3264 *complex* conics tangent to your five conics are all isolated; in particular, degenerate conics are not allowed).
