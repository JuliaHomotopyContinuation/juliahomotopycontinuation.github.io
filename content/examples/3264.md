A [*conic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic) in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the zero set of a
quadratic polynomial in two variables:

$$  a_1 x^2 + a_2 xy + a_3 y^2  + a_4 x  +  a_5 y  +  a_6 .$$

Geometrically, a conic can be either a circle, an ellipse, a hyperbola, a parabola or a union of two lines.
The last case is a degenerate conic. Double lines are allowed.


A classic problem in [enumerative geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_geometry)
is [Steiner's conic problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner%27s_conic_problem) which asks:
<p style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
*How many conics are tangent to five given conics?*
</p>

Here is an example of Steiner's problem:

The picture shows in blue the 5 given conics below. The red ellipse is tangent to the 5 blue conics.

Steiner claimed in 1848 that there are at most 7776 conics tangent to 5 given conics.
He phrased his problem as that of solving five equations
of degree six on the 5-dimensional projective space $\mathbb{P}^5$.
Using Bézout's Theorem he argued that the equations coming from this question
have $6^5 = 7776$ solutions over the [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_numbers).
However, this number over counts because
there is a *Veronese surface* of extraneous solutions, namely
the conics that are squares of linear forms, i.e., double lines.


The correct count of non-degenerate conics is **3264**.
This was shown in 1859 by [Jonquières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_de_Jonquières) and
independently in 1864 by [Chasles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Chasles).
The number 3264 appears prominently in the book
[*3264 and all that*](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/joeharris/files/000-final-3264.pdf)
by [Eisenbud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eisenbud) and
[Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Harris_(mathematician)).


A delightful introduction to Steiner's problem was given by
[Bashelor, Ksir and Traves](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/22/Ford/Bashelor.pdf).
[Ronga, Tognoli and Vust](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.36.1425&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and [Sottile](https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9609007) showed how to
choose 5 real conics such that all
3264 complex solutions are <i>real</i>.
Although their proofs starts with an explicit construction, it is *not* constructive.

Using methods from [numerical algebraic geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_algebraic_geometry)
we adapted the proposed construction to find an explicit instance for which there are 3264 real conics.
We use **numerical homotopy continuation** to compute the 3264 conics.
[Smale's $\alpha$-theory](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4984-9_13) provides a way to give a **mathematical proof** that we found 3264 real conics; the keyword is [alphaCertified](http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/research/stories/alphaCertified/).
The computational proof can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/JuliaHomotopyContinuation/3264Data/archive/v1.0.zip).



An illustration of the arrangement is shown below.

It looks like the arrangement consists of 5 blue lines, rather than 5 blue conics. The next picture clarifies the situation.

   The red ellipse is tangential to all 5 blue conics. The close ups show that the conics that look like double lines, are actually hyperbolas.</figcaption>
