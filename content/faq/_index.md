## Why do I need this when I have Newton's method?

Newton's methods (a.k.a. Newton-Raphson method) is a simple and quick to solve a polynomial system.
However, in general Newton's method only converges when a good initial point is used, and even then this only yields
a *single* solution. But if you are interested in *all* possible solutions you are usually out of luck.
