An alternative to using the [solve function](/guides/examples.md) is solving a polynomial system $F=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ by monodromy. This approach is more efficient, but requires the user to provide at least one solution of $F=0$. Here is the basic idea:


Suppose $x$ is a solution $F(x)=0$ and that $F=F_{u_0}$ is a point in a family of polynomial systems $\mathcal{F}=\\{F_u : u\in \mathbb{C}^k\\}$ which is defined with $k\geq 1$ parameters. The monodromy method consists in moving around $u$ in a loop starting and ending at $u_0$ while tracking $x$ along that loop. After one iteration usually one has found a new solution $y\in \mathbb{C}^n$. This process then is repeated until some stopping criterion is fulfilled.


The general syntax for this is:


```julia
monodromy_solve(F_u, [x], uâ‚€, parameters = u)
```


<h3 class="section-head" id="monodromyexample"><a href="#monodromyexample">Example: computing the closest point on a variety</a></h3>


Consider the problem of computing the point on the variety


$$
V = \\{x=(x_1,x_2)^T\in \mathbb{R}^2 : f(x) = 0\\}, \text{ for } f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_2)^2,
$$


which minimizes the distance to the point $uâ‚€ = (-3,-2)$. The situation looks like this:


<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/images/cardioid0.png" maxwidth="400px"/></p>


The minimizer $x^\star$ is a solution to the system


$$
F_u = \begin{bmatrix}\det(\begin{bmatrix}x-u & \nabla_x(f)\end{bmatrix})\\\ f(x)\end{bmatrix} =0,
$$


where $\nabla_x(f)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$. Let's set up this system in Julia.


```julia
using DynamicPolynomials, LinearAlgebra

uâ‚€ = [-2; -1]

@polyvar x[1:2]
f = x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 - (x[1]^2 + x[2]^2 + x[1])^2
âˆ‡ = differentiate(f, x)

F = [det([x-uâ‚€ âˆ‡]); f]
```


Now, $x^\star$ is a zero of `F`, which has totaldegree equal to 12. However, the actual number of solutions is only 3 as was shown in [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0049.pdf). For avoiding computing all 12 paths, we use monodromy instead of totaldegree traicking.


An initial solution to `F` is $x_0=(0,1)^T$. Let's use this initial solution for monodromy:


```julia
using HomotopyContinuation

xâ‚€ = [0; 1]
@polyvar u[1:2]
F_u = [det([x-u âˆ‡]); f]

monodromy_solve(F_u, [xâ‚€], uâ‚€, parameters = u)
```

```

```


We get the three solutions. The following picture shows them:

The minimizer is $x^\star \approx (-1.68, -0.86)^T$.
