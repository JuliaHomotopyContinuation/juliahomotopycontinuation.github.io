      <description>Requirements If you have not yet installed HomotopyContinuation.jl, please consider the installation guide.
Solve your first system of equations Consider the following simple system of two polynomials in two variables.
$$ f=\begin{bmatrix}x^2+2y \\ y^2-2 \end{bmatrix} $$
Solving the equation $f=0$ can be accomplished as follows
using HomotopyContinuation # load the package into the current Julia session @polyvar x y; # declare the variables x and y f = [x^2 + 2y, y^2 - 2] result = solve(f) # solve f After the computation has finished, you should see the following output.</description>

      <description>A first example We are interested in the numerical solution of systems of polynomial equations like $$\begin{array}{rl} -x^5y &amp;amp;= (x^4 + y^4 - 1)(x^2 + y^2 - 2) \\ \frac12 &amp;amp;= x^2+2xy^2 - 2y^2 ;. \end{array}$$
Equivalently, we can see the solutions of this system of equations as the common zero set $V(f_1,f_2)$ of the polynomials $$ f_1(x,y) = (x^4 + y^4 - 1)(x^2 + y^2 - 2) + x^5y \quad \text{ and } \quad f_2(x,y) = x^2+2xy^2 - 2y^2 - \frac12 ;.</description>

      <description>The reach $\tau$ of an embedded manifold $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an important complexity measure for methods in computational topology, statistics and machine learning. Namely, estimating $M$, or functionals of $M$, requires regularity conditions and a common regularity assumption is that the reach $\tau &amp;gt;0$. The definition of $\tau$ is as follows:
$$\tau = \sup \{t\mid \text{all $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mathrm{dist}(x,M)&amp;lt;t$ have a unique nearest point on $M$}\}$$
where the distance measure $\mathrm{dist}$ is the Euclidean distance.</description>

A four bar linkage, also called four bar, is a mechanism of four bars connected in a loop by four joints. One bar is fixed to the ground and on top of the opposing bar sits a triangle called coupler triangle whose apex is called coupler point. In motion this coupler point follows a curve called coupler curve:</description>

 the configuration of the cameras (in the form of camera matrices); sets of 2D points in the $n$ two-dimensional images, where each set corresponds to one 3D point.</description>

Consider the following problem: Bob has three biased coins. He tosses the first one. If it&#39;s heads he chooses the biased coin in his left pocket, and if it&#39;s tails he chooses the biased coin in his right pocket. Bob then flips that coin 5 times. We consider those last 5 flips as the experiment. Therefore there are 6 possible outcomes: 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, or 5 heads.</description>

      <description>The article Random points on an algebraic manifold proposes an algorithm for sampling from probability densities on a variety based on linear slicing. In this example, we want to apply this algorithm to sample from the plane curve
$$V = \{ x=(x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1^4+x_2^4-3x_1^2-x_1x_2^2-x_2+1=0\}.$$
intersected with the box $B = [-2,2]\times [-2,2]$.
Suppose that $f:V\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is a measurable function. We want to sample from the density $f(x)/(\int_{V} f(x) \mathrm{d}V)$.</description>

      <description>Cyclooctane (CH₂)₈ is a molecule that consists of eight carbon atoms aligned in a ring, and eight hydrogen atoms, each of which is attached to one of the carbon atoms. The distance $c&amp;gt;0$ between neighboring carbon atoms is fixed.
In this example, we want to study the conformation space of cyclooctane with Homotopy Continuation. The equations for the positions $z_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$ of the carbon atoms satisfy the algebraic equations
$$\Vert z_1-z_2\Vert^2 = \cdots = \Vert z_7-z_8\Vert^2=\Vert z_8-z_1\Vert^2 = c^2.</description>

      <description>Consider three Gaussian random variables $X_1,X_2,X_3$ with means $\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3$ and variances $\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2,\sigma_3^2$. The density of $X_i$ is
$$\phi_i(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}; e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}.$$
A mixture of the three random variables is the random variable $U$ with density
$$\psi(x) = a_1, \phi_1(x), + ,a_2 ,\phi_2(x), + ,a_3 ,\phi_3(x), \quad\text{ for } \quad a_1+a_2+a_3 =1.$$
The method of moments recovers $\psi$ from the moments
$$m_k = \int x^k ,\psi(x); \mathrm{d}x.$$
Since we have 8 unknowns, we expect to need at least 8 moments to recover $\psi$.</description>

$$ \text{minimize} ; 3x^3y+y^2z^2-2xy-4xz^3 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad x^2+y^2+z^2=1 $$
The strategy to find the global optimum is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find all critical points of the objective function such that the equality constraint is satisfied. We start with defining our Lagrangian.
using HomotopyContinuation, DynamicPolynomials @polyvar x y z J = 3x^3*y+y^2*z^2-2x*y-x*4z^3 g = x^2+y^2+z^2-1 # Introduce auxillary variable for Lagrangian @polyvar λ # define Lagrangian L = J - λ * g 3x³y - 4xz³ + y²z² - x²λ - y²λ - z²λ - 2xy + λ In order to compute all critical points we have to solve the square system of equations</description>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing the point on
$$ V = \{x=(x_1,x_2)^T\in \mathbb{R}^2 : f(x) = 0\}, \text{ for } f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_2)^2, $$
which minimizes the distance to the point $u₀ = (-3,-2)$. The situation looks like this:
The minimizer $x^\star$ is a solution to the system
$$ F_u = \begin{bmatrix}\det(\begin{bmatrix}x-u &amp;amp; \nabla_x(f)\end{bmatrix})\\ f(x)\end{bmatrix} =0, $$
where $\nabla_x(f)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$.</description>

      <description>Let two ellipses be centered at points $p_1,p_2$: $$ E_i( r ) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x-p_i)^T Q_i^TQ_i(x-p_i) = r^2\},; i=1,2, $$ where $Q_1, Q_2$ are symmetric matrices.
We wish to find the smallest radius $r$ for which $E_1( r )\cap E_2( r )$ is not empty. Let $r^\star$ be the solution for this optimization problem. In Julia we translate this into a polynomial system:
using HomotopyContinuation, LinearAlgebra # generate the variables @polyvar Q₁[1:2, 1:2] Q₂[1:2, 1:2] p₁[1:2] p₂[1:2] @polyvar x[1:2] r z₁ = x - p₁ z₂ = x - p₂ # initialize the equations for E₁ and E₂ f₁ = (Q₁ * z₁) ⋅ (Q₁ * z₁) - r^2 f₂ = (Q₂ * z₂) ⋅ (Q₂ * z₂) - r^2 # initialize the equation for E₁ and E₂ being tangent @polyvar λ g = (Q₁&amp;#39; * Q₁) * z₁ - λ .</description>

      <description>Parameter Homotopies Consider the situation in which one has to solve a specific instance of a parametrized family of polynomial systems
$$ P = \{F(x,p) = (f_1(x,p), \ldots, f_n(x,p)) \mid p \in \mathbb{C}^m\}. $$
To not destroy the solution structure it is desirable to not leave $P$ during the homotopy. This can be accomplished by using the homotopy $$H(x,t) := F(x, (1-t)p + tq)$$ where $p$ and $q$ are parameters in $\mathbb{C}^m$.</description>

      <description>Consider a physical system of $N$ particles $q=(q_1,\ldots,q_N)\in M$. In our example we take $M$ to be the space of configurations of cyclohexane. The $q_i$ are then the spacial positions of the six carbon atoms in a cyclohexane molecule. The constraints of this molecule are the following algebraic equations:
$$ M = \{(q_1,\ldots,q_6)\in (\mathbb{R}^3)^6 \mid \Vert q_1-q_2\Vert^2 = \cdots= \Vert q_5-q_6\Vert^2 = \Vert q_6-q_1\Vert^2 = c^2\}, $$

$$\int_{V} f(x) \mathrm{d}x,$$
where $V\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is an open submanifold of an algebraic variety and $f:V\to \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function.
For instance, for $f(x)=1$, this integral gives the volume of $V$. In this example, we want to use homotopy continuation to approximate this integral. We will use the Monte Carlo integration proposed in this article.
Integrating functions with homotopy continuation Let $n=\mathrm{dim}, V$, and let $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times N}$ and $b\in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a matrix-vector pair with independent standard Gaussian entries.</description>

      <description>The monodromy method An alternative to using the solve function is solving a polynomial system $F=(f_1,\ldots,f_n)$ by monodromy. This approach is more efficient, but requires the user to provide at least one solution of $F=0$. Here is the basic idea:
Suppose $x$ is a solution $F(x)=0$ and that $F=F_{u_0}$ is a point in a family of polynomial systems $\mathcal{F}=\{F_u : u\in \mathbb{C}^k\}$ which is defined with $k\geq 1$ parameters. The monodromy method consists in moving around $u$ in a loop starting and ending at $u_0$ while tracking $x$ along that loop.</description>

It is known that with probability one a random complex $2\times 2\times 2\times 3$-tensor has rank equal to 4:

The advantage of so called polyhedral homotopies over totaldegree homotopies is that the number of paths to track can be significantly smaller for the polyhedral homotopy.

      <description>Overdetermined systems A system of polynomial equations $f=(f_1(x_1,\ldots, x_m),\ldots, f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_m))$ is called overdetermined, if it has more equations than variables; i.e., when $n&amp;gt;m$. HomotopyContinuation.jl can solve overdetermined systems. Here is a simple example.
$$f(x,y,z) = \begin{bmatrix} xz-y^2 \\ y-z^2 \\ x-yz \\ x + y + z + 1\end{bmatrix}.$$
This system has 4 equation in 3 variables. One might expect that it has no solution, but actually it has solutions, as is explained here.</description>

      <description>Curvature of curves in the plane Consider the problem of computing the point on a (smooth) curve $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where the curvature is maximal. We can use the following formula for curvature at a point $p\in V = \{f(x_1,x_2)=0\}$.
$$\sigma(p) = \frac{v^T H v}{g^\frac{3}{2}}$$
where $v^T ,\nabla_p f(p) = 0$, and $v^T , v=1$, and $H$ is the Hessian of $f$ at $p$, and $g = \nabla_p f(p)^T\nabla_p f(p)$. The conditions for $\sigma(p)$ being maximal on $V$ are thus $v^T , \nabla_p \sigma(p)=0$ and $f(p)=0$.</description>

      <description>A conic in the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the zero set of a quadratic polynomial in two variables:
$$ ,, a_1 x^2 ,+, a_2 xy ,+, a_3 y^2 , +, a_4 x , + , a_5 y , + , a_6 ,.$$
Geometrically, a conic can be either a circle, an ellipse, a hyperbola, a parabola or a union of two lines. The last case is a degenerate conic. Double lines are allowed.</description>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the following picture shows 14 circles that are tangent to
$$C_1 = \{y=-x^2+2x+5\},$$
$$C_2 = \{y = 2x^2+5x-8\},$$
$$C_3 = \{y = 8x^2-3x-2\}.$$
Emiris and Tzoumas write that there are 184 complex circles that are tangent to 3 general conics. This means, that there are 184 complex solutions $(a_1,a_2,r)$ such that there exists some $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ with</description>

      <description>Choosing a start system for homotopy continuation is an art for itself. We give some basic rules for start systems. They can roughly be subdivided into three classes:
I know nothing about the structure of my polynomial system In this case, there are two options: choosing a totaldegree start system, or a polyhedral start system.
The first one is suitable for system, which are dense. The second one is suitable for systems, which are sparse.</description>

      <description>If your system of polynomials is given as a composition of several systems, you can exploit this in HomotopyContinuation.jl.
Composition of two systems If $f$ and $g$ are your systems, and you want to solve $f \circ g$, then you can do this by
solve(f ∘ g) For instance, if
$$ f = \begin{bmatrix} ab - 2\\ ac- 1\end{bmatrix}, \quad g = \begin{bmatrix}x + y\\ y + 3\\ x + 2\end{bmatrix},$$</description>

      <description>Introduction To track solutions from a start system $G$ to the target system $F$ we use by default the straight-line homotopy
$$ H(x,t) := (1-t)F+tG;. $$
But this is in general not the best choice since you usually leave the solution space of your problem. Therefore we support the ability to define arbitrary homotopies where you have the full power of Julia available.
In the following we will illustrate how to setup a custom homotopy on the following example.</description>

      <description>We provide two special functions for analysing data: UniquePoints and Multiplicities. They do the following: suppose that A is an array of real or complex vectors. Then, UniquePoints(A) filters multiple elements of A, such that each entry appears once. On the other hand, multiplicities(A) returns the indices of multiple elements in A.
UniquePoints Here is the full syntax of UniquePoints
UniquePoints(A, distance; tol=1e-5) where
 distance is a function to measure the distance between two vectors.</description>

      <description>By default, solve(f) return only &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; solutions of f. But when tracking towards f paths might diverge to infinity (solutions at infinity describe solutions of the homogenization of f which are no solutions of f itself).
To save the results of all paths, one has to use
solve(f, save_all_paths = true) Here is an example that has solutions at infinity.
julia&amp;gt; using HomotopyContinuation julia&amp;gt; @polyvar x y julia&amp;gt; f = [x^2 - y^2 - 1, x - y] julia&amp;gt; solve(f, save_all_paths = true) Result with 0 solutions ================================== • 0 non-singular solutions (0 real) • 0 singular solutions (0 real) • 2 solutions at infinity • 2 paths tracked • random seed: 229664 </description>

      <description>When your system has a multiprojective structure, you can declare variables groups for accelerating the computations.
Here is a simple example for the following system defined over $\mathbb{CP}^1\times \mathbb{CP}^1$:
$$f(u,y,u,v) = \begin{bmatrix} xy - 6uv\\ x^2 - u^2 \end{bmatrix}.$$
The Julia code for the variable groups ${x,y}$ and ${u,v}$ is as follows.
julia&amp;gt; using HomotopyContinuation julia&amp;gt; @polyvar x y u v julia&amp;gt; f = [x*y - 6u*v, x^2 - u^2] julia&amp;gt; S = solve(f, variable_groups=[(x,u), (y,v)]) Result with 2 solutions ================================== • 2 non-singular solutions (0 real) • 0 singular solutions (0 real) • 2 paths tracked • random seed: 127575 With out the declaration of groups we would have</description>

      <description>Sometimes, one has to compute solutions in projective space $\mathbb{RP}^n$ or $\mathbb{CP}^n$ . This space is defined as the space of all lines in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, respectively $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, passing through the origin. HomotopyContinuation.jl automatically recognizes systems of defined over projective space and adjusts the output.
Here is a simple example involving two random quadrics in $\mathbb{CP}^2$
using HomotopyContinuation, LinearAlgebra @polyvar x y z v = [x, y, z] F = [ v ⋅ (randn(ComplexF64, 3, 3) * v); v ⋅ (randn(ComplexF64, 3, 3) * v); ] For solving $F=0$ one can just use the solve command</description>

      <description>Totaldegree is a particular choice of start system for homotopy continuation.
It is the simplest start system for a system
$$ F(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\begin{bmatrix} f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \\ \vdots\\ f_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \end{bmatrix}. $$
The totaldegree start system of $F$ is
$$ G(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \begin{bmatrix} x_1^{d_1} - a_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n^{d_n} - a_n\end{bmatrix}, \text{ where } d_i = \text{deg}(F_i), $$
and where the $a_i$ are random numbers. There are $d_1\cdots d_n$ many solutions to this system, which are easy to write down.</description>

      <description>By default, HomotopyContinuation.jl tracks paths in the complex vector space $\mathbb{C}^n$.
It is also possible to track paths in projective space. This has the advantage that all paths have finite length, because projective space is compact.
One can tell HomotopyContinuation.jl to track over projective space by using the flag projective_tracking = true:
using HomotopyContinuation @polyvar x y f = [x^2 + y - 1, y - 4] solve(f, projective_tracking = true) This is the same as</description>
