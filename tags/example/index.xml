      <description>(Update Sept. 4 2018: there have been some typos in the first version of this post. They have been fixed.)
In a recent discussion with Maddie Weinstein and Khazhgali Kozhasov we considered the problem of computing the maximal curvature of an algebraic manifold $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ (a smooth manifold that is also a real algebraic variety ).
Our definition of maximal curvature is $\sigma: = \mathrm{sup}_{p\in V} \sigma(p)$, where $\sigma(p)$ is the maximal curvature of a geodesic through $p$:</description>

      <title>The number of circles that are tangent to 3 given conics</title>

      <description>In the previous blog entry I mentioned the Macaulay2 interface for HomotopyContinuation.jl that is currently under development. In this blog post I want to show how useful this interface can be.
Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 given conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. For instance, the following picture shows 14 circles that are tangent to $$C_1 = \{y=-x^2+2x+5\}, C_2 = \{y = 2x^2+5x-8\}, C_3 = \{y = 8x^2-3x-2\}.</description>
