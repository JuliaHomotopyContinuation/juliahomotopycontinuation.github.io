      <description>Consider the problem of reconstructing a tensor $T\in\mathbb R^{n_1\times \cdots \times n_d}$ from linear measurements $\mu_1(T), \ldots, \mu_s(T)$, where each $\mu_i: \mathbb R^{n_1\times \cdots \times n_d}\to \mathbb R$ is a linear function.
This problem is called tensor recovery. If the $\mu_i$ are coordinate projections this is also known as tensor completion.
For a fixed measurement $y\in\mathbb R^s$, there are infinitely many tensors $T\in\mathbb R^{n_1\times \cdots \times n_d}$ with
$$\mu(T) = (\mu_1(T), \ldots, \mu_s(T)) = y.</description>

      <description>The reach $\tau$ of an embedded manifold $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is an important complexity measure for methods in computational topology, statistics and machine learning. Namely, estimating $M$, or functionals of $M$, requires regularity conditions and a common regularity assumption is that the reach $\tau &amp;gt;0$. The definition of $\tau$ is as follows:
$$\tau = \sup \{t\mid \text{all $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\mathrm{dist}(x,M)&amp;lt;t$ have a unique nearest point on $M$}\}$$
where the distance measure $\mathrm{dist}$ is the Euclidean distance.</description>

      <description>Author: Irem Portakal
Consider three people $A$, $B$ and $C$ playing a non-cooperative game and they have all 3 (mixed) strategies each. Each person has a payoff matrix depending on which strategies have been performed. For example for the person $A$, the entry $A_{ijk} \in \mathbb{Q}$ is the value of the payoff for person $A$ when $A$ performs the strategy $i$, $B$ the strategy $j$ and $C$ the strategy $k$. The indices $i$, $j$, and $k$ run over ${1,2,3}$, thus these define three $3\times 3 \times 3$ matrices (or tensors).</description>

      <description>The paper Sampling and homology via bottlenecks by Di Rocco et. al. introduces a novel algorithm for producing a provably dense sample of a smooth and compact algebraic variety. Using the $\textit{bottlenecks}$ we obtain bounds on the density of the sample needed in order to guarantee that the homology of the variety can be recovered from the sample. This example implements the algorithm for the case when the variety is a smooth and compact complete intersection.</description>

We want to reconstruct a three-dimensional object from two-dimensional images. Think of an object, maybe a dinosaur, that is captured by $n$ cameras from different angles. Suppose we have the following information available:
 the configuration of the cameras (in the form of camera matrices); sets of 2D points in the $n$ two-dimensional images, where each set corresponds to one 3D point.</description>

Consider the following problem: Bob has three biased coins. He tosses the first one. If it&#39;s heads he chooses the biased coin in his left pocket, and if it&#39;s tails he chooses the biased coin in his right pocket. Bob then flips that coin 5 times. We consider those last 5 flips as the experiment. Therefore there are 6 possible outcomes: 0 heads, 1 head, 2 heads, 3 heads, 4 heads, or 5 heads.</description>

      <description>The article Random points on an algebraic manifold proposes an algorithm for sampling from probability distributions on a variety based on linear slicing. In this example, we want to apply this algorithm to sample from the plane curve
$$V = \{ x=(x_1,x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x_1^4+x_2^4-3x_1^2-x_1x_2^2-x_2+1=0\}.$$
intersected with the box $B = [-2,2]\times [-2,2]$.
Suppose that $f:V\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is a measurable function. We want to sample from the density $f(x)/(\int_{V} f(x) \mathrm{d}V)$.</description>

      <description>Cyclooctane (CH₂)₈ is a molecule that consists of eight carbon atoms aligned in a ring, and eight hydrogen atoms, each of which is attached to one of the carbon atoms. The distance $c&amp;gt;0$ between neighboring carbon atoms is fixed.
In this example, we want to study the conformation space of cyclooctane with Homotopy Continuation. The equations for the positions $z_i\in\mathbb{R}^3$ of the carbon atoms satisfy the algebraic equations
$$\Vert z_1-z_2\Vert^2 = \cdots = \Vert z_7-z_8\Vert^2=\Vert z_8-z_1\Vert^2 = c^2.</description>

      <description>Consider three Gaussian random variables $X_1,X_2,X_3$ with means $\mu_1,\mu_2,\mu_3$ and variances $\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2,\sigma_3^2$. The density of $X_i$ is
$$\phi_i(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2}}.$$
A mixture of the three random variables is the random variable $U$ with density
$$\psi(x) = a_1 \phi_1(x) + a_2 \phi_2(x) + a_3 \phi_3(x), \quad\text{ for } \quad a_1+a_2+a_3 =1.$$
The method of moments recovers $\psi$ from the moments
$$m_k = \int x^k \psi(x) \mathrm{d}x.$$
Since we have 8 unknowns, we expect to need at least 8 moments to recover $\psi$.</description>

      <description>We want to solve following optimization problem
$$ \text{minimize} 3x^3y+y^2z^2-2xy-4xz^3 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad x^2+y^2+z^2=1 $$
The strategy to find the global optimum is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find all critical points of the objective function such that the equality constraint is satisfied. We start with defining our Lagrangian.
using HomotopyContinuation, DynamicPolynomials @var x y z J = 3x^3*y+y^2*z^2-2x*y-x*4z^3 g = x^2+y^2+z^2-1 # Introduce auxillary variable for Lagrangian @var λ # define Lagrangian L = J - λ * g 3x³y - 4xz³ + y²z² - x²λ - y²λ - z²λ - 2xy + λ In order to compute all critical points we have to solve the square system of equations</description>

      <description>Consider the problem of computing the point on
$$ V = \{x=(x_1,x_2)^T\in \mathbb{R}^2 : f(x) = 0\}, \text{ for } f(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_2)^2, $$
which minimizes the distance to the point $u₀ = (-3,-2)$. The situation looks like this:
The minimizer $x^\star$ is a solution to the system
$$ F_u = \begin{bmatrix}\det(\begin{bmatrix}x-u &amp;amp; \nabla_x(f)\end{bmatrix})\\ f(x)\end{bmatrix} =0, $$
where $\nabla_x(f)$ is the gradient of $f$ at $x$.</description>

      <description>Let two ellipses be centered at points $p_1,p_2$: $$ E_i( r ) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x-p_i)^T Q_i^TQ_i(x-p_i) = r^2\}, i=1,2, $$ where $Q_1, Q_2$ are symmetric matrices.
We wish to find the smallest radius $r$ for which $E_1( r )\cap E_2( r )$ is not empty. Let $r^\star$ be the solution for this optimization problem. In Julia we translate this into a polynomial system:
using HomotopyContinuation, LinearAlgebra # generate the variables @polyvar Q₁[1:2, 1:2] Q₂[1:2, 1:2] p₁[1:2] p₂[1:2] @polyvar x[1:2] r z₁ = x - p₁ z₂ = x - p₂ # initialize the equations for E₁ and E₂ f₁ = (Q₁ * z₁) ⋅ (Q₁ * z₁) - r^2 f₂ = (Q₂ * z₂) ⋅ (Q₂ * z₂) - r^2 # initialize the equation for E₁ and E₂ being tangent @polyvar λ g = (Q₁&amp;#39; * Q₁) * z₁ - λ .</description>

      <description>Consider a physical system of $N$ particles $q=(q_1,\ldots,q_N)\in M$. In our example we take $M$ to be the space of configurations of cyclohexane. The $q_i$ are then the spacial positions of the six carbon atoms in a cyclohexane molecule. The constraints of this molecule are the following algebraic equations:
$$ M = \{(q_1,\ldots,q_6)\in (\mathbb{R}^3)^6 \mid \Vert q_1-q_2\Vert^2 = \cdots= \Vert q_5-q_6\Vert^2 = \Vert q_6-q_1\Vert^2 = c^2\}, $$

      <description>Consider the problem of numerically approximating an integral of the form
$$\int_{V} f(x) \mathrm{d}x,$$
where $V\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is an open submanifold of an algebraic variety and $f:V\to \mathbb{R}$ is a measurable function.
For instance, for $f(x)=1$, this integral gives the volume of $V$. In this example, we want to use homotopy continuation to approximate this integral. We will use the Monte Carlo integration proposed in this article.
Integrating functions with homotopy continuation Let $n=\mathrm{dim} V$, and let $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times N}$ and $b\in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a matrix-vector pair with independent standard Gaussian entries.</description>

First, we compute the dimension of $Q_3$. We use coordinates by setting the first matrix to be $A_0 = \mathrm{diag}(a_{1},a_{2},a_3)$, where $a_1,a_2,a_3$ are variables. Then, we have the following situation:
$$ f:V \to W,\; (a_1,a_2,a_3,A_1,A_2,A_3) \mapsto \text{coefficients of }\det\Big(\sum_{i=0}^4x_iA_i\Big), $$</description>

In that article they compute the number of canonical polyadic decompositions (CPD) of a random $2\times 2\times 2\times 3$-tensor by using the monodromy method. It is known that with probability one a random complex $2\times 2\times 2\times 3$-tensor has rank equal to 4:

      <description>Curvature of curves in the plane Consider the problem of computing the point on a (smooth) curve $V\subset \mathbb{R}^n$, where the curvature is maximal. We can use the following formula for curvature at a point $p\in V = \{f(x_1,x_2)=0\}$.
$$\sigma(p) = \frac{v^T H v}{g^\frac{3}{2}}$$
where $v^T \nabla_p f(p) = 0$, and $v^T v=1$, and $H$ is the Hessian of $f$ at $p$, and $g = \nabla_p f(p)^T\nabla_p f(p)$. The conditions for $\sigma(p)$ being maximal on $V$ are thus $v^T \nabla_p \sigma(p)=0$ and $f(p)=0$.</description>

$$C_3 = \{y = 8x^2-3x-2\}.$$
Emiris and Tzoumas write that there are 184 complex circles that are tangent to 3 general conics. This means, that there are 184 complex solutions $(a_1,a_2,r)$ such that there exists some $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ with</description>
