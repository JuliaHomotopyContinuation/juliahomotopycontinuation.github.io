      <description>In the previous blog entry we mentioned the Macaulay2 interface for HomotopyContinuation.jl that is currently under development. In this blog post we want to show how useful this interface can be.
Consider the problem of computing all circles that are tangent to 3 given conics $C_1,C_2,C_3 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Emiris and Tzoumas write that there are 184 complex circles that are tangent to 3 general conics. This means, that there are 184 complex solutions $(a_1,a_2,r)$ such that there exists some $(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}^2$ with</description>
